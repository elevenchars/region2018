Why do you cry out thus, unless at some vision of horror? 
"The house reeks of death and dripping blood."
How so? Tis but the odor of the altar sacrifice. 
"The stench is like a breath from the tomb."
The darksome statesman, hung with weights and woe 
Like a thick midnight fog, moved there so slow
